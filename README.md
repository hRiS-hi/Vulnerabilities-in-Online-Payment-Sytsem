# Vulnerabilities-in-Online-Payment-Sytsem
## Introduction
Online payment systems are essential for modern shopping and banking, allowing quick and easy transactions. However, as more people use digital payments, there are more opportunities for security threats and fraud. These issues can come from flaws in the payment system or from cyber attacks aimed at stealing financial information.<br/>
To combat this, machine learning is being used to detect fraudulent transactions. By analyzing large amounts of data, machine learning can find patterns and unusual activities that indicate fraud, often before it becomes a problem. Understanding and fixing these vulnerabilities is key to keeping online payments safe.
